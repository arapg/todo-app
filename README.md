# Todo App

This is the final assignment for the course Backend 1. The task is to make a functional todo application where users can register, log in, add friends as well as add, edit and remove todo lists. Within the todo lists users can add, edit and delete tasks, and of course mark them as complete. Additionally, once logged in a user can see their friends' todo lists and tasks as well.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
