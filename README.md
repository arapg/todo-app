# Todo App

This is the final assignment for the course Backend 1. The task is to make a functional todo application where users can register, log in, add friends as well as add, edit and remove todo lists. Within the todo lists users can add, edit and delete tasks, and of course mark them as complete. Additionally, once logged in a user can see their friends' todo lists.

## Available Scripts

In the project root directory, you can run:

### `npm run start`

It will run both the server and client simultaneously, the client will open on its own but if it doesn't, you can go to <http://localhost:3000/>. Server runs on port 5050.

## Run client and server separately
In the terminal, you can run:

### `cd server/src && node server.js`
To start the server.

### `cd client && npm run start`
To start the client, make sure you start up the server before you do so.
